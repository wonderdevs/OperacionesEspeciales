```Certainly, here is an example of how you could implement a sanity system in your TTRPG:

1.  Sanity Points: Each character starts with a certain number of Sanity Points (SP). This number should be relatively high (e.g. 50-100) to reflect the fact that most characters start out mentally healthy.
    
2.  Triggering Events: Whenever a character is exposed to a traumatic or frightening event (e.g. witnessing a horrific death, being tortured, etc.), they must make a Sanity Check. The difficulty of the check is determined by the severity of the event, and can be modified by any relevant character traits or circumstances.
    
3.  Failing a Sanity Check: If a character fails a Sanity Check, they lose a certain number of Sanity Points. The amount lost depends on the severity of the event and can be modified by any relevant character traits or circumstances. For example, witnessing a gruesome murder might result in a loss of 1-5 Sanity Points, while being tortured for hours might result in a loss of 10-20 Sanity Points.
    
4.  Temporary Insanity: If a character loses a certain amount of Sanity Points (e.g. 50% of their starting SP), they suffer from Temporary Insanity. This can manifest in a variety of ways, depending on the character's personality and the events they've experienced. Some possible effects of Temporary Insanity include hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, or a complete breakdown of personality.
    
5.  Permanent Insanity: If a character loses all of their Sanity Points, they suffer from Permanent Insanity. This means that their mind has been permanently damaged by the traumatic events they've experienced, and they may be unable to function normally. The exact effects of Permanent Insanity should be determined by the GM, and may depend on the character's personality and the events they've experienced.
    
6.  Recovery: Characters can recover Sanity Points over time, through rest, therapy, or other means. However, recovering Sanity Points should be difficult and take a significant amount of time. Depending on the severity of the trauma, it may be impossible to fully recover from some events.
    

By implementing a Sanity System, you can add a new layer of depth to your TTRPG and encourage players to think about the mental well-being of their characters, in addition to their physical health. The system can also provide opportunities for role-playing and character development, as players explore the psychological effects of the events they've experienced.```

Idea 2:
Sure, I can help you create a sanity system for your TTRPG. Here's an example of one approach:

1.  Establish a Sanity Score: Each character begins with a starting Sanity score, which represents their mental resilience and ability to cope with stress. This score might be determined by the character's background, skills, or other factors. For example, a character with military training might start with a higher Sanity score than a civilian.
    
2.  Track Sanity Points: As characters are exposed to traumatic events, they gain Sanity points. The amount of points gained might depend on the severity of the event, such as witnessing a comrade's death, being tortured, or seeing civilians killed. For example, witnessing a comrade's death might result in 1 Sanity point, while being tortured might result in 3 or more Sanity points.
    
3.  Determine Effects of Sanity Loss: As characters accumulate Sanity points, they begin to suffer from mental effects such as anxiety, depression, or paranoia. You might create a table that lists different effects and the threshold at which they occur. For example, at 5 Sanity points, a character might suffer a -1 penalty to all rolls due to anxiety, while at 10 Sanity points, they might suffer from vivid hallucinations that affect their perceptions.
    
4.  Allow for Recovery: Characters can recover Sanity points over time, either through rest and relaxation, or through counseling or therapy. You might allow characters to recover 1 Sanity point per day of rest, or require them to seek out specialized help in order to recover more quickly.
    
5.  Incorporate Roleplaying: As characters suffer from mental effects, encourage players to roleplay their character's responses to stress and trauma. This might involve creating backstory or developing quirks that reflect their character's mental state. For example, a character who has witnessed too much death might become increasingly detached and unfeeling, while a character who has been tortured might develop a fear of confined spaces or authority figures.
    
6.  Use Sanity to Drive the Story: As characters suffer from mental effects, incorporate these effects into the larger story arc. For example, a character who is suffering from anxiety might be more likely to make mistakes or overlook important details, while a character who is suffering from paranoia might see threats where there are none. This can create interesting plot twists and challenges for the characters to overcome.
    

Remember, the goal of a sanity system is to create interesting roleplaying opportunities and challenges for the characters, not to punish players or make the game overly difficult. By creating a balanced and well-designed sanity system, you can add an extra layer of depth and realism to your TTRPG.
