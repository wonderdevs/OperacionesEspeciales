Literalmente son las 3 de la ma√±ana. Le he preguntado a ChatGPT como puedo hacer que este sistema no se convierta en algo estacando donde los jugadores solo disparan desde cobertura. y me dado esto y me encanta

One way to encourage players to use short-term and team-based strategies in combat is to design the combat encounters in such a way that simply shooting from cover isn't always the best or most efficient option. Here are a few ideas:

1.  Vary the Terrain: If the battlefield has varied terrain, with hills, buildings, and other obstacles, players will need to adapt their strategies depending on where they are on the map. For example, if there's a high point that provides a good vantage point, players might need to fight to control it in order to gain an advantage over the enemy.
    
2.  Introduce Time Pressure: If players know that they need to complete an objective within a certain amount of time, they'll be forced to take risks and move quickly rather than simply waiting for the enemy to come to them. For example, if there's a bomb that needs to be defused, players might need to move quickly to find and disarm it while under fire from enemy forces.
    
3.  Use Specialized Enemies: If the enemy forces have specialized units that are resistant to certain types of attacks, players will need to coordinate their efforts in order to take them down. For example, if the enemy has heavily armored units, players might need to use explosives or flanking maneuvers to take them out.
    
4.  Provide Incentives for Risk-Taking: If there are objectives on the battlefield that provide significant rewards for capturing them, players will need to take risks and work together in order to succeed. For example, if there's a supply cache that provides valuable weapons or ammunition, players might need to fight through enemy lines in order to reach it.
    
5.  Use Environmental Hazards: If the battlefield has hazards such as fires, explosions, or collapsing structures, players will need to adapt their strategies in order to avoid taking damage or getting trapped. For example, if a building is on fire, players might need to find alternate routes or risk taking damage while moving through the flames.
    

By designing combat encounters that encourage players to take risks and work together, you can guide them towards using short-term and team-based strategies rather than simply shooting from cover. Additionally, you can use in-game rewards and penalties to reinforce these behaviors, such as giving bonus experience or loot for completing objectives in a certain way, or penalizing players who refuse to cooperate or take unnecessary risks.
